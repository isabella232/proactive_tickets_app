          <span class="bold">Seamless support workflows</span><br />
          <span>Creating proactive tickets provide your support team a more organized way to take charge of your customer conversations.</span>

    <div class="support_point">
      <span class="bold">How will this impact my ticket workflows?</span><br />
      <span>The Proactive Ticket app will not affect your current ticket workflows. The app simply creates new tickets which will follow the existing workflows you have set up.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="support_point">
      <span class="bold">Can I customize my proactive ticket workflow?</span><br />
      <span>Yes! Simply create a trigger for your proactive tickets. Each proactive ticket campaign has a unique tag which you can set as one of your trigger conditions.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="support_point">
      <span class="bold">How do I view and report on proactive tickets?</span><br />
      <span>The Proactive Tickets app automatically creates a ticket view based on your campaign. You can manage your tickets from that view, as well as create custom reports using Insights.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="support_point">
      <span class="bold">How many proactive tickets can I create?</span><br />
      <span>We recommend creating no more than 1,000 proactive tickets per campaign. Remember to not create more tickets than your team can reasonably support.</span>
